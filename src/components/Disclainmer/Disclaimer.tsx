          <p>
            We try our best to make sure that the information on our pages is
            accurate and up-to-date. However, we are not liable for any errors
            or omissions in the content. As a service provider, we are only
            responsible for our own content on this web page according to ยง 7,
            Paragraph 1 of the German Broadcast Media Act (TMG) and other laws.
            We are not required to check or monitor any external information
            that we transmit or store on this web page, or to investigate any
            illegal activity related to it. We still have to follow the law and
            remove or block any information that is unlawful. But we can only be
            held liable for this if we know about the specific violation of law.
            If we find out about any such violations, we will remove the content
            right away.

            We respect your privacy and do not collect any personal data from

            data with anyone else without your consent. Please read our General
            Terms and Conditions for more details. Please note that data
            transmission over the internet (e.g. via e-mail) is not completely

          <h5>Data Privacy Protection when using Google Analytics</h5>
          <p>
            We use Google Analytics, a service that helps us analyze how
            visitors use our website. Google Analytics uses cookies, which are
            small files that store information on your device. These cookies
            collect data about your website usage and send it to Google servers
            in the US. Google may also share this data with other parties if
            required by law or for processing purposes12. We have enabled IP
            anonymisation on our website, which means that Google will mask your
            IP address before sending it to their servers. This reduces the
            chance of identifying you personally3. However, this may not apply
            in some rare cases where Google needs to send your full IP address
            for technical reasons4. You can opt out of Google Analytics by
            changing your browser settings or
            <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">
