Java access modifiers are essential for controlling the accessibility and visibility of classes, methods, and variables within a program. They are keywords that are used to set the accessibility level of objects and data in Java. There are four types of access modifiers in Java, each with a different level of accessibility.

1. ### Private.

   Members marked as private can only be accessed within the same class in which they are declared. This modifier is the most restrictive of all access modifiers and is useful for encapsulating data and methods within a class, preventing direct access from other classes or packages. There are 4 types of access modifiers in Java

2. ### Default, also known as package-private.

   Members with no access modifier specified (i.e., no public, private, or protected keyword) can only be accessed within the same package. This modifier is useful when you want to limit access to certain members of a class to only classes in the same package.

3. ### Protected.

   Members marked as protected can be accessed within the same package and by subclasses in other packages. This modifier is useful when you want to allow some access to a variable or method, but not full public access.

4. Public.

   Members marked as public can be accessed from anywhere, both within and outside the package. This modifier is useful for creating libraries or APIs that can be used by other programmers.

That's it for today, understanding the different access modifiers and their usage is essential for creating secure and well-organized code. By choosing the appropriate access modifier based on the needs of your program and the level of security you want to provide, you can create a program that is easy to maintain and extend.
